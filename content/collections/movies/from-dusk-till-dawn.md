The director credit is often mistakenly attributed to Tarantino because of how similar to his the grimey style of this movie is. And Quentin indeed plays one of the lead roles, along with George Clooney.

Criminals and their captives take shelter at a truck stop populated with vampires, which leads to chaotic results.

It is enough to watch this epic film for Salma Hayek's brilliant sexy appearance.
