I love a film that authentically surprises the audience with a plot twist, keeping them on edge all the way to the last frame. Writing this is almost a spoiler for this illusive picture with the venerable Michael Douglas.

Among the many things I admire about this movie is that it is set in San Francisco, a city I once called home.
