Rushed to the theatres to compete in basically the same genre as The Matrix this film is a treat for all lovers of layered realities where one doesn’t know what’s genuine and what’s imaginary.

In the plot people are able to play full-immersion games and organically exist in designed worlds.

If you listen to electronic music, you might pick up on a quote or two that you already heard in a song.
